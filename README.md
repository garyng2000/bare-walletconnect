# bare-walletconnect
A bare minimum implementation of walletconnect 1.0 protocol in different languages/environment

This is intended as a library so it can be used in various situations(frontend/backend/mobile etc.), each language implementation would be under its own directory using with associated toolchain(for simple testing etc.)

I want to keep this a single source file approach that can be a dropped into any project
